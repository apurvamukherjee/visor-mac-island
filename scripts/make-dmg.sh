# The window dressing: background art with the drag arrow, icon positions, no
# toolbar. Finder only persists this into the volume's .DS_Store if the disk is
# writable and mounted, so the .dmg is built read-write, decorated, detached,
# then converted to the compressed read-only image that actually ships.
# The art lives INSIDE Visor.app, not at the volume root. A root-level
# `.background.tiff` (or a `.background/` folder) is a real entry in the
# window for anyone browsing with AppleShowAllFiles=1, and `chflags hidden`
# does not help them — Finder lists flagged items anyway (verified). Putting
# it in the bundle means the volume ships exactly two visible entries.
# The .DS_Store's `icvp` record stores the background as a Carbon *alias* to a
# real file, so the file cannot simply be deleted before detach: the record
# survives, the alias dangles, and the window paints plain grey (measured).
# One multi-resolution .tiff rather than a 1x/2x pair — macOS reads the Retina
# rep out of the tiff the same way it reads a "@2x" sibling, and `tiffutil` is
# part of macOS, so it adds no dependency.
